MacroDeck Services is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the following changes:

    * MacroDeck is not bound by the GPL
    * All others will be bound by the GPL unless authorized by MacroDeck
    * All others must make their modified source available free of charge
	  unless otherwise authorized by MacroDeck 

These changes are not intended to limit what you can do with the software. If you want to use our services
API in your Rails application, feel free to do so (given that you follow the GPL). If you modify our
sourcecode, we'd like to be able to take whatever improvements you've made and use them for the benefit
of everyone (if we wanted). We feel that these extra licensing terms protect everyone's rights as a whole
somewhat better than the GPL alone. Additionally, we are not bound by the GPL because we will be linking to
Services in a non-GPL-compatible way.

The GPL is available in LICENSE.GPL.
