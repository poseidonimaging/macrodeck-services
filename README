MacroDeck Services
==================

This is MacroDeck Services, a plugin designed for Ruby on Rails. Services
provides several libraries of functions (called "services") to Rails
applications. In particular, it is the glue that makes our Facebook
application, Places <http://apps.facebook.com/macrodeckplaces/>,
work. Originally, the plugin was not "written in the Ruby way", so has quite
a few Java-esque names floating around. We're working on cleaning that mess
up (and it is a mess). Also, originally, we had the generic data handler
set up to have a thick line between node containers (DataGroups) and nodes
(DataItems). This ended up causing many problems in designing applications,
and such has been thrown out in favor of a redesigned tree-based system called
DataObjects. Also, since that point, new Rails features have enabled us to do
a lot of what we tried to do with the separation.

It is also important to know that every DataObject, User, and pretty much
everything else has an associated Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID). The
purpose of this is to allow relationships between unlike objects. For example,
a User can be related to a DataObject (or a child thereof) without needing to
specify that the field contains a User. The reason for this is that while it is
possible for two rows in two tables to contain the same primary key (id), it is
not possible for two rows in two tables to contain the same UUID. Originally,
we went insane with UUIDs and made it harder on ourselves by not using the
Rails has_many and belongs_to functionality. We do now though, but older code
definitely doesn't show it! :)

Anyway, here's the currently working list of services and what they do:

* base_service: The base service that all other services inherit from. Does
  not do anything.
* comment_service: Handles wall posts (comments) for other data types.
* data_service: The storage backend for everything that isn't a file.
* event_service: Handles events, calendars, and other date/time-related data.
* navigation_service: Handles breadcrumbs for MacroDeck pages (underdocumented)
* places_service: Handles cities and places for MacroDeck, currently doesn't
  do too much, but will be extended in the future to do neat things like
  geocoding.
* storage_service: Currently unused service that functions as a file storage
  backend. Written by a programmer that up and quit on us, so it may not be
  finished; we haven't had time to check.
* test_service: A service created as an example, doesn't do anything.
* user_serivce: Handles users and groups
* uuid_service: Created due to differences in how Ruby handles the name
  "UUID" as a class. At one point, the UUID gem was named "UUID", and worked,
  and a Ruby update came out that made it stop working. Additionally, it lets
  us extend that Gem (which we include due to the workaround needed to make it
  work with our Ruby) as needed, search objects for that UUID, etc.

There are also a ton of services in fixme that need QA or conversion to the new
DataObject system.

We're releasing this so you can play with it; it should be considered very
fluid and very beta, but we would appreciate anyone working on it that wants to
help out! It's released under the terms of the GNU General Public License,
version 2, or at your discretion, any later version, with exceptions (see the
